	<h1>Functions</h1>
	<p>In order to reduce the amount of code needed for an application, developers must identify blocks of code that can
		be reused, and arrange them into functions that can be called up when needed. This week we will focus on how to
		define a function, invoke it, pass along parameters, and also to manage variable scope.</p>

	<button id="step2">Run Function</button>

		/* STEP 1: Basic browser functions
		There are a number of functions that are included with most modern browsers - the replace() function is just one of many */

		// Interestingly, functions that are included with your browser are technically called 'methods' rather than functions.

		/* STEP 2: Anonymous versus named functions */
		var step2Button = document.querySelector('#step2');
		// Anonymous

		// Named function

		/* STEP 3: Function parameters
		Some methods or functions don't require any parameters (sometimes called arguments, properties, or attributes), while some do, 
		and others are optional. */

		// No parameters needed

		// Two parameters needed

		// Parameters optional
		// join

		// Next, open up scope.html and we will look at how the accessibility of variables depends on where they are defined/initialized.
